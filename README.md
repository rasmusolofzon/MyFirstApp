# MyFirstApp
My first Android app. It's done as a part of an assignment of a course at LTH, namely [MAMN01].

The app consists of three parts:
  1. You can input a text and display it on the screen.
  2. You can display the current accelerometer values continously on the screen.
  3. You can display a compass on the screen.
